# Sales exploration - Data Dashboarding and Reporting with IBM Cognos Analytics:

## Abstract for Data Dashboarding:
Despite the widespread popularity of smart electronics and home automation, our sales in this category appear to be stagnant. Preliminary observations indicate that our unit prices may not be aligning effectively with market trends, resulting in a flat sales trajectory.

To delve deeper into this matter and identify potential areas for improvement, we have implemented coupon programs and customer loyalty initiatives. However, the impact of these strategies remains uncertain, and we need a comprehensive analysis to determine their effectiveness.

Enclosed with this message, you will find the relevant file for our smart electronics product line. I kindly request that you conduct a thorough investigation into the following areas:

Market Comparison: Compare our unit prices with prevailing market trends for similar smart electronics products to identify any disparities.

Coupon and Loyalty Program Impact: Evaluate the effectiveness of our current coupon and customer loyalty programs. Determine if they are resonating with our target audience and contributing to increased sales.

Competitor Analysis: Analyze the pricing strategies and promotional activities of key competitors in the smart electronics market to identify potential gaps or opportunities.

Customer Feedback: Review customer feedback, if available, to gain insights into their perceptions of our smart electronics products, pricing, and promotional offerings.

Recommendations: Based on the findings, provide actionable recommendations to optimize our pricing strategy and enhance the impact of our promotional programs.
